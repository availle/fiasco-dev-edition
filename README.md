# fiasco-dev-edition

Fiasco is a collaborative storytelling game for 3 to 5 players. Information about fiasco can be found [here](http://bullypulpitgames.com/games/fiasco/).

This is a Fiasco playset, set in the world of developing "high-quality" software under pressure.

Development was initiated by [Toni Rheker](https://github.com/offbyoni) during a session at [SoCraTes 2017] (https://www.socrates-conference.de/). 

If you were a collaborator at this session and would like to see your name here, please drop me a line. 

First commit is just going to be a dump of the raw data. The next features will be a little more clustering and a layout with Markdown.
